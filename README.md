# FemtoSIP -- A minimal SIP client

*FemtoSIP* is a minimal, incomplete, and utterly broken Python SIP
implementation with the sole purpose to ring a phone for a certain period of
time. This is quite handy for certain home automation tasks, such as ringing all
phones in the house whenever someone rings at the door.

## How to use

*FemtoSIP* solely depends on Python 3 which is present on most Linux
installations and available for other platforms as well. To use the program,
clone this Git repository and execute the `./femtosip.py` program:

```sh
# Clone the program and go into the femtosip directory
git clone https://github.com/astoeckel/femtosip
cd femtosip

# Execute ./femtosip.py
./femtosip.py \
    --gateway 192.168.1.1 \       # IP address or hostname of the SIP server
    --user SIP_USER \             # SIP username
    --password SIP_PASSWORD \     # SIP password
    --call '**9' \                # Which phone number to call
    --delay 15.0                  # How long to wait til hanging up
```


## Compatibility

This code was hacked together in a few hours and tested with the following SIP servers

* AVM FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN 7390
* linphone 3.6.1 (libexosip2/3.6)

It is not guaranteed to work with any other server. Especially, it uses a TCP
connection for SIP, which is not supported by all endpoints.
